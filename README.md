# Kocurek Theme

Kocurek is a Jekyll theme for static sites published on GitHub Pages. It was developed for the Austin Convention Center Department for use on documentation sites.

## How it Works

Kocurek is installed as a gem in a Jekyll project. The theme includes default styling and layouts for a site's homepage, content pages, and navigation.

Content is edited directly in markdown files in the `collections/` subdirectories.

## Features

- Automated navigation generation
- Create Sections of grouped Pages
- Custom ordering for Sections, and for Pages within a Section
- Full site search (configuration required)
- WAG Accessibility
